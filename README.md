## Introduction

This page is for the work done for the following publication:

* Skaza, J. and Blais, B.S. 2015. [Modeling the Infectiousness of Twitter Hashtags](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00074).  eprint arXiv:1603.00074.

> This study applies dynamical and statistical modeling techniques to quantify the proliferation and popularity of trending hashtags on Twitter. Using time-series data reflecting actual tweets in New York City and San Francisco, we present estimates for the dynamics (i.e., rates of infection and recovery) of several hundred trending hashtags using an epidemic modeling framework coupled with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This methodological strategy is an extension of techniques traditionally used to model the spread of infectious disease. We demonstrate that in some models, hashtags can be grouped by infectiousness, possibly providing a method for quantifying the trendiness of a topic.

There are three main notebooks here.  

1. Download the twitter data from the twitter feed.
2. Extract time series data from the downloaded twitter data
3. Perform the MCMC analysis on the SIR parameters from the time series data
